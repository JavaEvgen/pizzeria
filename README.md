Pizzeria project with dynamical content and admin panel JavaEE JSP/Servlets

School project pizzeria pages. Dynamical content, admin panel with CRUD for adding/editing pizzas and ingredients. Shoppingcart and order system. Everything works fine, but since it's my first project the code isn't "beautiful" and need to be polished.
All the comments and names are in Finnish, sorry.

Made in Eclipse Luna

JSP/Servlets/DAO are used in the project

It is free to use. You can download it and see the code, check it and polish :)

Feel free to add your comments. It was my first project and I know it's kinda sh**, but it works! :D
Please add comments and give me advises!
